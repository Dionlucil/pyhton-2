# Python Assignment 2 â€“ List Operations

This assignment demonstrates a sequence of basic list operations in Python. It walks through how to manipulate lists using common methods such as `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `index()`.

##  Tasks Covered

1. **Create an empty list**
2. **Append elements** to the list: `10, 20, 30, 40`
3. **Insert** a new element (`15`) at the second position
4. **Extend** the list with `[50, 60, 70]`
5. **Remove** the last element from the list
6. **Sort** the list in ascending order
7. **Find and print** the index of the value `30`

## Output

After performing all the operations, the script prints:
- The index of the value `30`
- The final state of the list

### Example Output:
Index of 30: 4

Final my_list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

## File

- `ass2.py`: Python file containing the full script
